## Connectors
 - ######con-xy2500.lbr
   This is library for cheap, chinese connectors series XY2500 from the company named XINYA. Connectors are similar to PHOENIX CONTACT MSTBA with pin pitch of 5.08 mm and those should be compatible with my library too. They were made based on official XY2500 documentation (PDFs included with this repo). 
   Some examples of XY2500 connectors:
   ![6-pin horizontal (R-variant) connector](http://static4.tme.eu/products_pics/f/1/6/f163396ad8db6f101fc1a6652a3d9537/338858_t.jpg)
   ![2-pin vertical (V-variant) connector](http://static3.tme.eu/products_pics/8/3/2/832cce6cded05f7503ee600e4f4a8d82/338848_t.jpg)
   Here are some cable-mounted adapters compatible with those connectors:
